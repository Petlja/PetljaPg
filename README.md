# PatljaPg - make simple PyGame examples even simpler

PetljaPg is a small Python module intented to reduce boilerplate code in entry level PyGame programming.

Design principles of PetljaPg:

- PegljaPg should reduce entry barriers for PyGame learners
- PetljaPg should let a coder to code in PyGame with minimal interference of PetljaPg API
- PetljaPg can be easily dropped somewhere on a PyGame learning path
- PetljaPg need not provide any value to non-beginner developers


Initial focus areas of PetljaPg are:
- hide complexity of the main loop
- optionaly hide the initialization code
- enabe some user interaction with reduced complexity of event handling
